## A fragmant of code that that produce a value is called an expressions every value written is an expressions for ex: 77 and harry 

# OPERATORS IN JAVASCRIPT 

## ADDITION = + 
## SUBRACTION = - 
## MULTIPLICATION = * 
## EXPONENTIATION = ** Eska mtlb hh ki ek operator 4 brr multiply hoga jesse ki 45*45  aur do brr 45 *45 hoga ans hoga 4100625
## DIVISION = / 
## MODULS = % Yeah reminder dekhata hh 
## INCREMENT = ++ Yeah ek no. bada ke btata hh jisse ki a=10 hh toh yeah a=11 btayega 
## point to be notes is that : 

# a++ hh toh pehele yeah 10 dekhayega phir 11 baad wale a mei 
##  ++ a hh toh pehele yeah 11 dekhayga phir baad wale a mei 10 
## DECREMENT = -- 
# ASSIGNMENT OPERAATORS 
# = : x=y 
# += : x= x+y 
# -= : x=x-y 
# *= x*y idhr ek brr * h
# /= : x=x/y 
# %= : x=x%y 
# **= : x=x**y idhr doo brr ** hh

# COMPARISION OPERATORS 

# == equal to 
# ! = not equal 
# === equal value and type 
# ! = = not equal value and not equal type

# > greater than
# < less than 
# >= greater than or equal to 

# < = less than or equal to 

# ? ternary operator


# LOGICAL OPERATORS 

# && logical and

# || logical or 

# ! logical not joh false ko true bole or true ko false 

## apart from these we also have type and bitwise operators . Bitwise opeators perform bit by bit operations and number 

## dono true honge toh true print hoga 
## bakki 3 cases m false hoga dono false wale m bhi falise aur ek m bhi false hua toh bhi false 


# COMMENTS IN JS : Sometimes we want our programs to contain a text which is executed by the js engine SUCH a text is called comment in js 


# a comment in js can be written as follows

## LET a= 5 // is a single line coment 

## /* 
## I AM A 
# MULTILINE COMMENT */ ESKE AAGE * aayega 

# sometimes comment are used to prevent the execution of some lines of code 

## let switch = true ;
## // switch = false this comment will not execute 



# CONDITIONAL STATEMENT 

# Sometimes we might have to execute the block of code based off some condition 
# 1 if statement 
# 2 if else statement 

# 3 if else if else statement 

## promp apse puchta hh aur alert btata 
# the if statement in js looks like this : 

## if (condition ) { 
## // execute this code 
## }
 
	# the if statement evaluates the condition inside the ( ) . if the condition is evaluated to true , the code inside the body of if is executed else the code is not executed 

# IF ELSE STATEMENT 

## the if statement can have optional else clause 

## the syntax look something like this: 

## if ( condition) {

##   // block of code if condition is true 

## }

## else {

##  // block of code if condition is false

## } 

			## if the  condition is true, code inside if it executed else code inside else block is executed 

# IF ELSE IF STATEMENT 

		## Sometimes we might want to keep rechecking a set of condition one by one until one matches . we use if else if for achieving this 

## JS ternary operator 

## Evaluates a condition and execute the block of code based on the condition 

### condition ? exp 1 : exp 2

### ex of syntax ternary operator look likes this : 

###  (marks>10) ? ' YES ' : ' NO '

### IF marks are greater than 10 , u are passed else not
